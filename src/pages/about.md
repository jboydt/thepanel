## About The Panel

The first Software Industry Panel for Butte College students was presented on November 18, 2021.

We hope to make the panel an annual (maybe semi-annual?) event.

If you have questions about the panel, please contact any faculty member of the Computer Science department at Butte College ([department home page](https://programs.butte.edu/ProgramInfo/9/1873)).
