### Career building

<QuestionAnswer question="What do you look for in a mentor?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I want someone who is open minded, doesn't bash other coworkers, knows work life balance, and follows best
        practices. If they throw up a bad PR and talk like they know everything, they're probably not going to be a
        good mentor.
    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

After working in the industry for a while are there any other avenues of education (math, business, chemistry, psychology) that might have benefited you in either getting a job or making life in the industry easier? Or does it depend on the job?

What usually prompts you to make the change (in jobs/employers)?

<QuestionAnswer question="Do you often have to learn a completely new language/framework at a new job?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        Back end, but that's what I was looking for so it feels skewed.
    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

What kind of experience with programming did you have, coming into your first job with a math degree?

### Job search

<QuestionAnswer question="Is there any job you wanted to apply for but at the end you thought that it's probably not the best idea?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I applied at Zillow and in the end didn't take the job because it just felt wrong. Idk if it worked out, but
        I'm happy where I'm at now. I think going with your gut is a good idea. I got bad vibes from the interviews.
        They're a two way street, when you're in an interview know you'll likely work with those people.

<QuestionAnswer question="Do most people in this industry move from job to job frequently?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        Constantly, like monthly. Some new technology, maybe not a language but a new third party API, new queueing
        tech, a new framework, etc.
    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

<QuestionAnswer question="What websites what you look for a early first job? What keywords would type to look for time jobs? Do I type like 'junior software dev jobs' or something like that?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I basically do 100% referrals these days but Indeed was nice to me at times! I am unsure about good keywords,
        I just sifted through everything it felt like.
    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>


<QuestionAnswer question="From your experiences in looking for jobs, have you found more front-end or back-end jobs in demand?">
    <Answer author="James K." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#james">
        I have found plenty of both. It's not super fair though because "back-end" is so much more general than
        "front-end". That being said, if you like front-end work, be it mobile or web, you will have a pretty easy time
        finding opportunities to go after.

    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I collaborate with previous coworkers and see what they're up to. Lot's of times that's enough. Sometimes I'll
        read blogs or listen to podcasts.

</QuestionAnswer>

<QuestionAnswer question="Best mindset needed to hone your craft? What principles do you keep for this?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">

    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

When I hear "learn a new language", it sounds scary because I'm stumbling to learn one. How much easier does it become to swap like that?

### Misc

<QuestionAnswer question="What are the FAANG companies?">
    <Answer author="James K." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#james">
        FAANG is just one way of referring to Big Tech (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech). Specifically it stands
        for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. These companies often pay the most, have the most impactful
        projects, and have spent a lot on learning how to "do things right".
        <br />
        This are different than your "normal" tech companies (Spotify, Adobe, Build.com, etc.) and your startups (early
        Uber, Noom, ClockShark, etc.).
    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>


<QuestionAnswer question="What do 'front-end', 'back-end', and 'infrastructure' mean?">
    <Answer author="James K." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#james">
        A Front-end Developer usually builds visual things that a user can interact with. Back-end developers often
        build the systems that the front-end's pass user data to. These systems contain the "business logic" for the
        product. Infrastructure Developers are kind of newer. They often build tools and services that developers can
        use to build things faster. Their "customers" are often other developers at the company. These kinds of teams
        are how companies like Netflix can innovate so quickly while having 12,000+ employees.

<QuestionAnswer question="How much does making a salary change your drive compared to college life?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I generally learn just to learn. The salary helps give me motivation to work hard since I know the ceiling is
        high, but generally I want to learn new tech regardless of of it'll make me additional money.
    </Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

<QuestionAnswer question="Isn't money, the 'worst' drive? You can make decent amount of money in other spheres. The way we feel about the money (salary) might be different in a few years right?">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I think anything can be a good drive as long as in the end it makes you happy. For me personally I couldn't do
        this job if it was just for money, but I know I wouldn't give 100% if I knew my ceiling was low. I'm comfortable
        where I'm at but knowing I could pretty easily get 50% more than what I'm already making sure helps work just a
        bit harder.

<QuestionAnswer question="Any specific advice for us older kids (I’m 43) who is just now switching careers to dev?  I’m really passionate about programming and I LOVE learning it.">
    <Answer author="Travis W." authorLink="/docs/fall-2021/panelists#travis">
        I think loving to learn is ultimately what will get you to where you want to be. It's a marathon, not a Sprint.
        Just keep trucking along and learning. Be focused, when learning gets tough that's when you're really making
        progress. Don't swap topics once things get difficult.
