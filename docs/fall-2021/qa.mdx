### Career building

What do you look for in a mentor?

After working in the industry for a while are there any other avenues of education (math, business, chemistry, psychology) that might have benefited you in either getting a job or making life in the industry easier? Or does it depend on the job?

What kind of experience with programming did you have, coming into your first job with a math degree?

### Job search

Is there any job you wanted to apply for but at the end you thought that its probably not the best idea?

Do most people in this industry move from job to job frequently?

What websites what you look for a early first job? What keywords would type to look for time jobs? Do I type like
"junior software dev jobs" or something like that?

From your experiences in looking for jobs, have you found more front-end or back-end jobs in demand?

Best mindset needed to hone your craft? What principles do you keep for this?

When I hear "learn a new language", it sounds scary because I'm stumbling to learn one. How much easier does it become to swap like that?

### Recommendations for students

How did you manage your time as a student and how has that changed as you transitioned into a professional?

Along with internships, and studying, is there another activity that one can participate in to put on their portfolio?

What advice would you go back in time to give yourself regarding P&A2 had it been a struggle?

Are local companies inclined to offer an internship to someone who IS local?

### Misc
What are the FAANG companies?

What do "front-end", "back-end", and "infrastructure" mean?

How much does making a salary change your drive compared to college life?

Any specific advice for us older kids (I’m 43) who is just now switching careers to dev?  I’m really passionate about programming and I LOVE learning it.
